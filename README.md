# Epa-s-MVC-Framwork
controller : user interaction 

model : data and database/storing and retrieving data

views : what users sees on screen (HTML)

why mvc?

- Separation of concerns - code does stuff + code show stuff
- easier code reuse
- organized code
- secure code
- developer specialization - front end and the backend developer specialization
